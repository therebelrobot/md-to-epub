# Chapter 2: The Investigation

The team worked through the night, analyzing data and running simulations. What they found was both fascinating and terrifying.

## Breaking Down the Data

Dr. Thompson pulled up a visualization on the main screen. The pattern was unmistakable - a repeating sequence that couldn't be natural.

```python
def analyze_pattern(data):
    frequency = calculate_frequency(data)
    if frequency > THRESHOLD:
        return "Artificial origin detected"
    return "Natural origin"
```

### The Pattern

The sequence appeared in multiple datasets:

| Dataset | Frequency | Confidence |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Alpha   | 847 Hz    | 99.7%      |
| Beta    | 847 Hz    | 99.9%      |
| Gamma   | 847 Hz    | 100%       |

## A Startling Realization

Elena gasped as she cross-referenced the pattern with historical records. "This signal... it's been here for decades. We just didn't know how to look for it."

The implications were staggering[^1].

### Questions Without Answers

They faced more questions than answers:

1. Who created this pattern?
2. Why was it hidden?
3. What does it mean?

James began writing code to decode the pattern, his fingers flying across the keyboard. Whatever secrets it held, they would soon know.

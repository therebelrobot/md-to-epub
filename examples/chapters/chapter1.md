# Chapter 1: The Beginning

It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. The world as we knew it was about to change forever.

## A New Dawn

The morning started like any other, but there was something different in the air. People moved through the streets with purpose, unaware of what was coming.

### The Discovery

In a small laboratory on the edge of town, Dr. Sarah Chen made a discovery that would alter the course of human history. The sample under her microscope showed patterns she had never seen before.

## The Team Assembles

Sarah knew she couldn't do this alone. She reached out to her colleagues:

- **Dr. Marcus Thompson** - Theoretical physicist
- **Dr. Elena Rodriguez** - Biochemist
- **Dr. James Park** - Computer scientist

Together, they would uncover the truth.

The [[Chapter 2: The Investigation|investigation]] would begin immediately. Sarah also made notes about the [[research facility|old research facility]], which was no longer accessible but contained valuable historical data.

They would also need to review [[chapters/chapter2|the data analysis]] from the next phase.
